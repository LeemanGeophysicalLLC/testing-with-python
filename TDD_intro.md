# Test Driven Development Introduction

## Purpose
* Demonstrate how to implement a new feature with a TDD methodology.

With Test Driven Development (TDD), the tests serve as a sort of specification
for the software. This means we can separate our approach to coding into two
phases : what the code should do (writing the test from the specification) and
how the code should do it (writing the actual production code).

### Advantages
* Production code tends to be more minimalist (YAGNI principle)
