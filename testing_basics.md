# Testing Basics

## Purpose
* Understand the structure of a test.
* Learn how to run tests.
* Learn how to check return values in tests.
* Write your own tests.

Tests in software are like rumble strips on the highway - they provide feedback
to the driver as early as possible when they depart their normal lane and gives
them time to correct the situation comfortably before they depart the road and
have an accident.

### The Four-Phase Test Pattern
The Four-Phase Test Pattern is described in Gerard Meszaros' book
["xUnit Testing Patterns"](https://amzn.to/2TjYE2O) and is a nice clear way to
structure your tests. It allows the reader to easily see what is being testing
and greatly increases the documentation value of the test.

1. **Setup** - Establish the preconditions to the test.
1. **Exercise** - Do something to the system.
1. **Verify** - Check the expected outcome.
1. **Cleanup** - Return the system under test to its initial state after the test.

## Running Tests
PyTest will automatically look for files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` and
from them run functions whose names begin with `test` and/or methods that
begin with `test` contained in classes that begin with `Test` and have no
`__init__`. There are some more custom configurations you can provide and the
full test discovery process is detailed
[here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#test-discovery)
in the documentation.

### Run the existing test suite
* First, look at the tests file - with a single test currently.
* Remind students of the Four-Phase testing we are doing.
* Open a terminal (or Anaconda Prompt).
* Run the command `pytest` and let the suite run.
* Look at and explain the test report.
* Modify the test so that it will fail and show what that report looks like.

## Checking Return Values

All tests need to use a form of the `assert` statement which will pass if the
conditional is `True` and fail if it is `False`. This can be as simple as
`assert a==b` and we should be striving for simplicity!

### String Comparison
Comparing strings is done with a simple equality check.

```python
def test_title_case():
    # Setup
    input = 'this is a test string'
    desired = 'This Is A Test String'

    # Exercise
    actual = input.title()

    # Verify
    assert actual == desired

    # Cleanup - none necessary
```

<div class="alert alert-success">
<b>Exercise 1</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Fill out the tests for the url builder function using what you know
    about string comparisons. The test names are descriptive enough that you
    already know what to do! If you don't know any station names, FSD, MLI,
    and AMW are a few you can choose from.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Solution
```python
def test_build_asos_request_url_single_digit_datetimes():
    """
    Test building URL with single digit month and day.
    """
    # Setup
    start = datetime.datetime(2018, 1, 5, 1)
    end = datetime.datetime(2018, 1, 9, 1)
    station = 'FSD'

    # Exercise
    result_url = meteogram.build_asos_request_url(station, start, end)

    # Verify
    truth_url = ('https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/asos/1min_dl.php?'
                 'station%5B%5D=FSD&tz=UTC&year1=2018&month1=01&day1=05&hour1=01'
                 '&minute1=00&year2=2018&month2=01&day2=09&hour2=01&minute2=00&'
                 'vars%5B%5D=tmpf&vars%5B%5D=dwpf&vars%5B%5D=sknt&vars%5B%5D=drct&'
                 'sample=1min&what=view&delim=comma&gis=yes')
    assert result_url == truth_url

    # Cleanup - none necessary


def test_build_asos_request_url_double_digit_datetimes():
    """
    Test building URL with double digit month and day.
    """
    # Setup
    start = datetime.datetime(2018, 10, 11, 12)
    end = datetime.datetime(2018, 10, 16, 15)
    station = 'MLI'

    # Exercise
    result_url = meteogram.build_asos_request_url(station, start, end)

    # Verify
    truth_url = ('https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/asos/1min_dl.php?'
                 'station%5B%5D=MLI&tz=UTC&year1=2018&month1=10&day1=11&hour1=12'
                 '&minute1=00&year2=2018&month2=10&day2=16&hour2=15&minute2=00&'
                 'vars%5B%5D=tmpf&vars%5B%5D=dwpf&vars%5B%5D=sknt&vars%5B%5D=drct&'
                 'sample=1min&what=view&delim=comma&gis=yes')
    assert result_url == truth_url

    # Cleanup - none necessary
```

### Numerical Comparison
Numerical comparisons are a common place that new testers start getting into
trouble. Testing integers is straightforward:

```python
def test_does_three_equal_three():
    assert 3 == 3
```

Trouble begins immediately when we leave the integer world though! Floating
point comparisons are fraught with peril. If you really want to get into why
there is a lot of light bedtime reading about the IEEE 754 specification and
how machine precision results in small rounding errors. For our purposes we
will simply say that this is **NOT** a safe thing to do:

```python
def test_floating_subtraction():
  # Setup
  desired = 0.293

  # Exercise
  actual = 1 - 0.707

  # Verify
  assert actual == desired

  # Cleanup
```

The best way to deal with this is to add a tolerance check, something like:

```python
def test_floating_subtraction():
    # Setup
    desired = 0.293

    # Exercise
    actual = 1 - 0.707

    # Verify
    assert(abs(actual-desired) < 0.00001)

    # Cleanup
```

That would result in too much logic and duplicated code in our tests and seems
like a solved problem right? Numpy has a testing helper for exactly this:
`numpy.testing.assert_almost_equal`.

Now our test can simplify to:
```python
from numpy.testing import assert_almost_equal


def test_floating_subtraction():
    # Setup
    desired = 1.5

    # Exercise
    actual = 3 - 1.5

    # Verify
    assert_almost_equal(actual, desired)

    # Cleanup - none necessary
```

<b>Exercise 2</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a function to the library to calculate the vector components u, v
        of wind given a windspeed and direction.</li>
    <li>Write tests to verify proper behavior for directions of 0, 45, 360, and
        for a windspeed of zero.</li>

        directions, respectively.

    """
    direction = np.radians(direction)
    u = -speed * np.sin(direction)
    v = -speed * np.cos(direction)
    return u, v

```python
def test_wind_components_north():
    # Setup
    speed = 10
    direction = 0

    # Exercise
    u, v = meteogram.wind_components(speed, direction)

    # Verify
    true_u = 0
    true_v = -10
    assert_almost_equal(u, true_u)
    assert_almost_equal(v, true_v)

def test_wind_components_northeast():
    # Setup
    speed = 10
    direction = 45

    # Exercise
    u, v = meteogram.wind_components(speed, direction)

    # Verify
    true_u = -7.0710
    true_v = -7.0710
    assert_almost_equal(u, true_u, 3)
    assert_almost_equal(v, true_v, 3)


def test_wind_components_threesixty():
    # Setup
    speed = 10
    direction = 360

    # Exercise
    u, v = meteogram.wind_components(speed, direction)

    # Verify
    true_u = 0
    true_v = -10
    assert_almost_equal(u, true_u)
    assert_almost_equal(v, true_v)


def test_wind_components_zero_wind():
    # Setup
    speed = 0
    direction = 45

    # Exercise
    u, v = meteogram.wind_components(speed, direction)

    # Verify
    true_u = 0
    true_v = 0
    assert_almost_equal(u, true_u)
    assert_almost_equal(v, true_v)

    # Cleanup
```

### Array Comparison

Array comparisons are much like integer and floating point comparisons.
In this case we're going to use `np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal` to
cleanup our tests we just wrote.

#### Instructor Code

from numpy.testing import assert_almost_equal, assert_array_almost_equal


def test_wind_components():
    # Setup
    speed = np.array([10, 10, 10, 0])
    direction = np.array([0, 45, 360, 45])
